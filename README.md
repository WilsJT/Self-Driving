# Overview

This project attempts to create a self driving model in the track racing game, "Trackmania". Vehicle autonomy has blown up over the last several years for numerous reasons such as convenience, safety, environmental, and more. The use of virtual environments have been an incredible boon for vehicle autonomy development by accelerating the testing process and lowering both physical and monetary costs. Not only does this benefit the industry, it creates an opportunity for individuals to experiment and learn about topics such as machine learning and computer vision.

## Variables
<ul>
  <li>Distances: How far away is the car to the walls</li>
  <li>Speed: How fast is the car moving</li>
 </ul>

## Screen Capture

Vision is an important sense that we tend to rely on, not just in driving, but throughout our daily lives. Our visual system is constantly working to collect and provide information about the environment. Computer vision is a field of study that tries to enable computers to do just that. So, to begin, I need a way to capture the screen before I can begin collecting data. 

## Region of Interest

When capturing the screen, there's a lot information coming in from the background that won't be needed in this project. I can capture the screen only in the area I'm interested in by defining a region of interest. By getting rid of the unhelpful information, it will help speed up the distance calculations later.

Currently testing different regions of interest

## Edge Detection

I'm interested in how for away the car is to the walls so in order to get the distance, I need to detect where the walls are.
